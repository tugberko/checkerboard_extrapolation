# Checkerboard Extrapolation using Scikit-Learn

This project explores the use of various scikit-learn classifiers to extrapolate a checkerboard pattern. The code is written in Python and requires pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn to be run.

## Usage

To run the project, simply run the `main.py` file. This will generate a checkerboard pattern and train several scikit-learn classifiers to predict the colors of the squares in the pattern.

The classifiers used in this project include:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors

Once the classifiers have been trained, their performance is evaluated using F1-score. The results are printed to the output images.

## Results

The results of the classifier comparison can be found in the `classifier_comparison.png` file. This file contains a bar graph showing the accuracy of each classifier.
